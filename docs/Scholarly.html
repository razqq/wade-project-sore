        <h2 style="color:rgb(126, 31, 126)">1. Abstract</h2>
        This paper presents the design and implementation of an innovative web-based recommendation system that leverages a user-specific knowledge graph, expressed in RDF (Resource Description Framework), to provide personalized recommendations. The system uniquely assimilates data from users' social media profiles, utilizing various features and properties to tailor suggestions. It is capable of recommending a diverse array of items, including people, events, places, and other interests, by analyzing and synthesizing complex data relationships within the knowledge graph.
        
        At its core, the system employs a modular architecture, comprising a React-based frontend, a Node.js backend, and MongoDB for data storage, supplemented by a dedicated graph database for managing RDF data. The architecture facilitates efficient data ingestion, sophisticated query handling via a SPARQL endpoint, and dynamic recommendation generation based on machine learning algorithms. The integration of user feedback serves as a mechanism for continuous learning and improvement of the recommendation accuracy.
        
        The systemâ€™s modular design not only enhances scalability and maintainability but also allows for independent and parallel development of its components. This paper details the system's architecture, data flow, and the interplay between its various modules, emphasizing the use of modern web technologies and data processing techniques. We also discuss the challenges faced in integrating diverse data sources and the strategies employed to ensure a seamless, user-friendly experience. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated through a series of use cases, highlighting its capability to adapt to user preferences and behaviors, thereby offering a highly personalized user experience.
