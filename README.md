Develop a Web modular system able to recommend certain items of interest (people, events, places, other things) according to a given knowledge graph expressed in RDF and automatically built for a specific user – for example, based on her/his social media profile(s) – by considering multiple similar features/properties. For instance, suggesting the members of an IT team based on desired skills (excellent knowledge of certain areas like Web technologies + open hardware), geographic location (i.e. from Romania and Chile only), technical preferences (e.g., using free software), background info (demographics, education, occupation history, driving license, other competencies), hobbies (i.e. horror movies + classical music), aversions (e.g., communication by phone, sport, politics) and so on. The system should be "smart" enough to improve recommendations based on various methods such as user feedback, reasoning, and/or machine learning. The recommended items will be available via a SPARQL endpoint.
