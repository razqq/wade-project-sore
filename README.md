Develop a Web modular system able to recommend certain items of interest (people, events, places, other things) according to a given knowledge graph expressed in RDF and automatically built for a specific user – for example, based on her/his social media profile(s) – by considering multiple similar features/properties. For instance, suggesting the members of an IT team based on desired skills (excellent knowledge of certain areas like Web technologies + open hardware), geographic location (i.e. from Romania and Chile only), technical preferences (e.g., using free software), background info (demographics, education, occupation history, driving license, other competencies), hobbies (i.e. horror movies + classical music), aversions (e.g., communication by phone, sport, politics) and so on. The system should be "smart" enough to improve recommendations based on various methods such as user feedback, reasoning, and/or machine learning. The recommended items will be available via a SPARQL endpoint.

## Status

### 1.Midterm Deliverables—Design & Architecture: A (10%) – Week #9 - 100% ✅

- ✅ A general (service-oriented) architecture of the Web application to be developed + the overall design from the point of view of a software engineer (for example: main modules, software architecture diagrams, input/output data formats, data/task flows, etc.) and concerning the end users.
    - contained inside the main [research document](https://github.com/razqq/wade-project-sore/blob/main/docs/Scholarly.html)

- ✅ An OpenAPI specification regarding the REST API – or, alternatively, a schema for the GraphQL API – provided by the project, including various usage examples and pragmatic case studies.
Technical Writing
    - contained [here](https://github.com/razqq/wade-project-sore/blob/main/docs/openAPIs)

- ✅ A Scholarly HTML technical report (its digital content will be equivalent to a minimum of four A4 printed pages) consisting of preliminary considerations about the internal data structures/models to be used and the external data sources – e.g., public Web services and/or APIs – managed by the Web application to be developed. Also, explain how the solution conforms to the linked data principles.
Readme Template
    - contained [here](https://github.com/razqq/wade-project-sore/blob/main/docs/Scholarly.html)

- ✅ A public wiki associated to the WADe project repository should record the solution's progress. The content must be available in English language and minimally tagged with project, infoiasi, wade, and web.
    - contained in [this readme](https://github.com/razqq/wade-project-sore/blob/main/README.md)

tags: #project, #infoiasi, #web
